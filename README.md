# A meta-heuristic way to solve a combinatorial problem
 
Abstract—
”Given a list of cities and the distances between each
pair of cities, what is the shortest possible path that visits each
city exactly once and returns to the starting city?”
The Traveling salesman problem has been one of the most studied
combinatorial problem for the past two decades. This problem
is quite easy to represent, and since it lies in the category of
NP-hard problems, it is a interesting research problem. The goal
of this paper is to look at performance of heuristic algorithms,
which are less time consuming and more computer friendly than
the robust method of testing every single possibility.
In this paper, we will focus on two heuristic algorithms. The
Nearest Neighbor algorithm and the Ant Colony optimization
algorithm.
