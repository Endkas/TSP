        Parameters
        ----------
        n : Number of cities you want to generate
        seed : The seed you want to use for random.seed(seed=seed), optional.
        The default is 10. The seed is by default the same for all the different classes,so
        that with the same number of cities, the matrix of distances is the same.
        With that we can compare results of different algorithms as it exactly the same numbers in the
        distances'matrix.
        

        At the initizialtion of the object, the method matdist is applied.
        
        With this class Cities,we want to create n cities,with latitudes and longitudes.
        With thoses we can generate a matrix of distances and then apply our different 
        algorithm to solve the Travelling Salesman Prblem.
        
        Cities will be the superclass of BruteForce,nearest neighbour and ant classes.
